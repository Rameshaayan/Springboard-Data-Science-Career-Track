Background and Problem  
Coronavirus disease 2019 is known as COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV which is an infectious disease. This virus leads to acute respiratory syndrome in many patients. The first alarm of COVID-19 disease was in December 2019 in Wuhan (capital of Hubei province) in China and has since spread globally were ongoing today as coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 is currently one the most lifethreatening problems around the world. The fast and accurate detection of the COVID-19 infection is essential to identify, take better decisions and ensure treatment for the patients which will help save their lives. In this project, we study a fast and efficient way to identify COVID19 patients with multitask deep learning (DL) methods.   
Dataset 
In this study, we used github repository for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) The dataset is available in the time series format with date, month and year so that the temporal components are not neglected.
